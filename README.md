Greenr

# Project Description:
Our project aims to tackle UN sustainable development goals 3: Good Health and Well-Being, 11: Sustainable Cities and Development, and 13: Climate Action. We aim to do this in 3 main ways:

1) Give the general public easy access to data on pollution levels.
2) Raise awareness about the different kinds of pollution and the harmful effects they have on peoplesâ€™ health.
3) Encourage people to take an active role in caring for their community.
